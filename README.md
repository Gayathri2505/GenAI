# Poetry Generator using LSTM

## Overview 
The LSTM-based Poem Generator project aims to develop an innovative system capable of automatically generating original poetry based on user-provided prompts. Leveraging deep learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) , particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this project addresses the need for a versatile tool that assists writers, artists, and enthusiasts in exploring various themes and styles of poetry.

## Key Features

- Utilizes LSTM neural networks to capture patterns and structures in poetic language.
- Employs bidirectional LSTM layers and dropout regularization to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.
- Enables collaboration within literary communities through shared writing projects and poetry challenges.
- Supports fine-tuning of hyperparameters to optimize model performance and output quality.
- Prompt based generation of results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for building the model has been obtained from Kaggle. The dataset is a compilation of poetries written by numerous poets present in the form of a text file. We can easily use this data to generate embeddings and subsequently train an LSTM model.

The dataset can be accessed by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshalgadhe/poem-generation)

## Steps to Use the generator
- Download the Ipython Notebook File (.ipynb) and the dataset from the repository.
- Open it in Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab - Use GPU enabled execution for faster and efficient training of the model.
- Once trained, Give input prompts to the system and the output will be generated which is relevent and coherent to the input.
- Explore different prompts and settings to experiment with various writing styles and themes.
